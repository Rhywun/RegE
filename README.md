# RegE
A simple SwiftUI experiment

## Introduction

My goal with this app is to learn [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) 2.0. It's inspired by a tutorial for [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/) (a cross-platform .NET UI library itself inspired by [WPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation)) of the same name which I found [here](https://habr.com/en/post/469703/).

The app is a simple tool for testing Regular Expressions - enter a regular expression and some input text, and any matches are dispayed in the output box.
